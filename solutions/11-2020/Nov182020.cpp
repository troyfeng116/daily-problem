We have a list of tasks to perform, with a cooldown period. We can do multiple of these at the same 
time, but we cannot run the same task simultaneously.

Given a list of tasks, find how long it will take to complete the tasks in the order they are input.
tasks = [1, 1, 2, 1]
cooldown = 2
output: 7 (order is 1 _ _ 1 2 _ 1)
